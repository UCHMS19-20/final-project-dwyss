### Description

This game is a text-based 2 player baseball game which acts similar to the way the a game such as rock-paper-scissors does.

One player will be the pitcher and will have to input a choice of the pitch that they want to throw.
The choices include the following:
* fastball
* curveball
* changeup
* slider

The other player, the hitter, will have to input the type of swing that they want.
The choices include the following:
* normal swing
* power swing
* contact swing
* no swing

For each of the 16 combinations of inputs, there is a different play the results, such as a home run, a groundout, or a strike.

The game continues until there is 3 outs.
